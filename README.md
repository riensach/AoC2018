# AoC2018
https://adventofcode.com

This is a collection of code created to solve puzzles for the AoC2018 calendar. I'm not really a coder anymore, so the code isn't in anyway good, but I wrote it and it works.

Note: some puzzles are solved with the addition of manual calculation on the existing output (mainly a part 2). I'm lazy/busy so that was quicker
